SUMMARY = "WireGuard is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN"
DESCRIPTION="WireGuard is a secure network tunnel, operating at layer 3, \
implemented as a kernel virtual network interface for Linux, which aims to \
replace both IPsec for most use cases, as well as popular user space and/or \
TLS-based solutions like OpenVPN, while being more secure, more performant, \
and easier to use."
