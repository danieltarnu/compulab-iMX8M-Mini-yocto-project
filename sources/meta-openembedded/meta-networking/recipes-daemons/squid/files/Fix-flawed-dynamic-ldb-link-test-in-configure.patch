Subject: [PATCH] Fix flawed dynamic -ldb link test in configure

The test uses dbopen, but just ignores the fact
that this function may not exist in the db version
used.  This leads to the dynamic link test failing
and the configure script just making assumptions
about why and setting the need for -ldb incorrectly.
