Subject: [PATCH] Enable obfuscating binaries natively.

Enable obfuscating binaries natively.

The samhain build process involves an obfuscation step that attempts to
defeat decompilation or other binary analysis techniques which might reveal
secret information that should be known only to the system administrator.
The obfuscation step builds several applications which run on the build host
and then generate target code, which is then built into target binaries.

This patch creates a basic infrastructure that supports building the
obfuscation binaries natively then cross-compiling the target code by adding
a special configure option.  In the absence of this option the old behaviour
is preserved.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [cross compile specific]
