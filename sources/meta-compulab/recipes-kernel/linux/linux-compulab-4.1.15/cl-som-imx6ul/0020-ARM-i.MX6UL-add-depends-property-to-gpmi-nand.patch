Subject: [PATCH 20/38] ARM: i.MX6UL: add 'depends' property to gpmi-nand

Add a new 'depends' property to the gpmi-nand node.
The purpose is to create a dependency between devices.
The ecspi4 bus driver with its siblings has to be configured first
in order to provide the correct mtd device order registration.
